# This file consists of common sites, apps, and their known dependencies.
# This list aims to create a block list to deny sites and dependencies.
#
# Please note, there may be some errors in this list and it may not catch
# everything.  If core components of a site or app are still allowed, refer
# to your pi-hole query log and add inclusions accordingly.
# 
# This list is only updated on occasion.  If you want to create your own
# gravity list, you may copy the content of this list as a starting point.
